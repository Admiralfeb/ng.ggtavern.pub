  <p>DM: You make a wrong turn and end up in the 404 Goblin workshop. Grumpy has a toy he wants to try on you. It looks
    like it might hurt if it bites. Gabby looks like she's itching for a fight ... or a meal, either way, those eyes
    spell danger. If anything happens to you, you won't be found.</p>
